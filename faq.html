                    <p>Oh, you know, just <strong>Gurgaon's only newsletter that actually tells you what's happening</strong> before your neighbors pretend they knew about it first. We send WhatsApp messages once a month with:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>That new restaurant on <strong>Golf Course Road</strong> everyone's Instagramming (yes, the pasta is overpriced)</li>
                        <li>Which bar on <strong>MG Road</strong> is having "the event of the year" this weekend (there are 47 more this month)</li>
                        <li>Why <strong>Cyber City</strong> parking was even worse than usual last Tuesday</li>
                        <li>The real reason that place in <strong>Sector 29</strong> suddenly closed (spoiler: it wasn't "renovations")</li>
                        <li>What everyone at <strong>DLF Cyber Hub</strong> is pretending not to know about</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Scrolling through 734 Instagram stories to figure out what's actually happening this weekend</li>
                        <li>Reading "Top 10 Things to Do in Gurgaon" articles written by someone who's clearly never been to <strong>Gurgaon</strong></li>

                        <li>Works on your phone, because you're not reading this on a desktop like it's 2009</li>
                        <li>You can actually see the pictures of that new place on <strong>MG Road</strong> without clicking "Display Images"</li>
