        <!-- TERMS OF SERVICE -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>📜 Terms of Service</h2>
            <p><em>Or: "The Rules of Engagement for Our Relationship"</em></p>
            
            <h3>1. Agreement to Terms (The "You're In" Part)</h3>
            <p>By subscribing to GossipYah, you're agreeing to these terms. If you don't agree, that's totally fine, but then you can't subscribe. <em>We're not trying to be difficult, it's just how this works.</em></p>
            
            <p>These terms constitute a binding agreement between you (the subscriber) and GossipYah (us, the people sending you Gurgaon gossip). By clicking "Join Now" or providing your information, you acknowledge that you've read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these terms.</p>
            
            <h3>2. The Service We Provide (What You're Getting Into)</h3>
            <p>GossipYah is a <strong>free monthly newsletter</strong> delivered via WhatsApp covering:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Events and parties</strong> happening in Gurgaon/Gurugram</li>
                <li><strong>Restaurant and bar openings, closings, and updates</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Social scene gossip and trending topics</strong> in Cyber City, Golf Course Road, MG Road, and across the millennium city</li>
                <li><strong>Insider information</strong> about Gurgaon's nightlife, dining, and entertainment</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> We send <strong>one newsletter per month</strong>. That's it. We're not going to spam you. We're not secretly trying to sell you stuff. We're just here to gossip.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>3. What We Need From You (Your Part of the Deal)</h3>
            <p><strong>Accurate Information:</strong> You agree to provide your real name and a working phone number. We can't send you gossip if "Batman" isn't a valid contact. <em>We've tried.</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>Legal Age:</strong> You must be at least 18 years old to subscribe. If you're younger, get your parents' permission first. <em>We're serious about this one.</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>Indian Phone Number:</strong> Currently, our service only works with Indian phone numbers with WhatsApp. If you're calling from the moon, we sadly can't help you yet.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Acceptable Use (Don't Be That Person)</h3>
            <p>You agree NOT to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use fake information to subscribe multiple times <em>(one newsletter per person, please)</em></li>
                <li>Share or republish our content for commercial purposes without permission</li>
                <li>Harass, abuse, or send spam to our contact channels</li>
                <li>Attempt to hack, reverse-engineer, or mess with our systems <em>(seriously, why would you?)</em></li>
                <li>Use the information to harm venues, individuals, or businesses mentioned in our newsletter</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>5. Intellectual Property (Who Owns What)</h3>
            <p>All content in GossipYah newsletters—text, images, design, gossip quality—is owned by GossipYah or our content partners. You're welcome to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Read it (obviously)</li>
                <li>Share screenshots with friends via WhatsApp or social media with credit</li>
                <li>Recommend venues or events to others</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You're <strong>NOT</strong> welcome to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Copy our entire newsletter and pretend you wrote it</li>
                <li>Republish our content on your blog/website without permission</li>
                <li>Use our content for commercial purposes <em>(if you want to monetize gossip, start your own newsletter)</em></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>6. Disclaimer of Warranties (The "Cover Our Assets" Section)</h3>
            <p>Let's be real: GossipYah is provided "as is" and we make no warranties about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> We do our best to verify information, but gossip is gossip. That new restaurant might delay its opening. That party might get canceled. <em>Such is life in Gurgaon.</em></li>
                <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> We can't cover everything happening in Gurgaon. If we missed something, sorry! Send us a tip for next month.</li>
                <li><strong>Timeliness:</strong> We send the newsletter once a month. If something happens after we send it, we can't go back in time. <em>We wish we could.</em></li>
                <li><strong>Service Availability:</strong> WhatsApp might be down. The internet might break. Mercury might be in retrograde. We'll do our best, but we can't guarantee 100% uptime.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>7. Limitation of Liability (Please Don't Sue Us)</h3>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
            <p>GossipYah, its owners, and contributors shall not be liable for any damages arising from your use of the service, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Showing up to a closed venue <em>(always call ahead!)</em></li>
                <li>Bad food at a recommended restaurant <em>(taste is subjective)</em></li>
                <li>Cover charges at events <em>(we don't control pricing)</em></li>
                <li>Getting gossip wrong at a party and looking foolish</li>
                <li>Any decisions made based on newsletter information</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Translation:</strong> We're giving you information, not guarantees. Use your judgment. We're not responsible if things don't go as expected. <em>We're a newsletter, not your life coach.</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>8. Termination (Breaking Up Is Hard to Do)</h3>
            <p><strong>You can leave anytime:</strong> Reply "STOP" or "UNSUBSCRIBE" to any message, or email us. No hard feelings.</p>
            
            <p><strong>We can remove you if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You violate these terms</li>
                <li>Your phone number becomes invalid</li>
                <li>You're abusive to our team</li>
                <li>We suspect fraudulent activity</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>9. Changes to Terms (We Might Update This)</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. If we make significant changes, we'll notify subscribers via our newsletter. Continued use after changes means you accept the new terms.</p>
            
            <p><em>We promise we won't pull any sneaky stuff. Any changes will be reasonable and in everyone's best interest.</em></p>
            
            <h3>10. Governing Law (The Boring But Necessary Bit)</h3>
            <p>These terms are governed by the laws of India. Any disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts in Gurgaon, Haryana, India.</p>
            
            <p><em>Hopefully it never comes to this, but lawyers made us include it.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- PRIVACY POLICY -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>🔒 Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><em>Or: "What We Do With Your Data (Spoiler: Not Much)"</em></p>
            
            <h3>1. Information We Collect (It's Really Not Much)</h3>
            <p>When you subscribe to GossipYah, we collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your Name:</strong> So we know what to call you <em>(first name is fine, we're not formal)</em></li>
                <li><strong>Your Phone Number:</strong> Because WhatsApp needs it to send you messages</li>
                <li><strong>Subscription Date:</strong> So we know when you joined our exclusive club</li>
                <li><strong>Consent Records:</strong> Documentation that you agreed to receive our newsletter</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>That's literally it. We don't collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your location (beyond the fact that you're interested in Gurgaon)</li>
                <li>Your browsing history</li>
                <li>Your email address <em>(unless you email us separately)</em></li>
                <li>Your social media profiles</li>
                <li>Your credit card information <em>(because it's FREE, remember?)</em></li>
                <li>Any other personal data</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2. How We Use Your Information (The Actual Truth)</h3>
            <p>We use your data for exactly <strong>ONE purpose:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Sending you our monthly Gurgaon gossip newsletter via WhatsApp.</strong></p>
            
            <p>That's it. We don't:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sell your data to third parties <em>(never, not even if they beg)</em></li>
                <li>Share it with partners <em>(we have no partners, we're independent)</em></li>
                <li>Use it for advertising <em>(we have no ads)</em></li>
                <li>Build psychographic profiles <em>(we barely understand ourselves)</em></li>
                <li>Train AI models on your data <em>(we're not that sophisticated)</em></li>
                <li>Rent it out <em>(is that even a thing?)</em></li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>In Plain English:</strong> Your name and number sit in our database. Once a month, our system sends you a WhatsApp message. That's the entire story. <em>We're boring like that.</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>3. How We Store Your Data (Fort Knox, But Digital)</h3>
            <p>Your information is stored on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Secure cloud servers</strong> with industry-standard encryption</li>
                <li><strong>Access-restricted systems</strong> (only authorized team members can see it)</li>
                <li><strong>HTTPS-secured connections</strong> (fancy way of saying "encrypted")</li>
                <li><strong>Regular backups</strong> (because hard drives fail sometimes)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We implement reasonable security measures including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encrypted data transmission</li>
                <li>Secure authentication protocols</li>
                <li>Regular security audits</li>
                <li>Limited access controls</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><em>We're not Fort Knox, but we're pretty close. Your data is safer with us than most places.</em></p>
            
            <h3>4. Data Retention (How Long We Keep Your Stuff)</h3>
            <p><strong>While you're subscribed:</strong> We keep your data indefinitely (because we need it to send you newsletters).</p>
            
            <p><strong>After you unsubscribe:</strong> We delete your information within <strong>30 days</strong>. Why 30 days? Because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We need to process your unsubscribe request</li>
                <li>We maintain a temporary "do not contact" list to prevent re-subscription errors</li>
                <li>Backup systems need time to purge data</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><em>After 30 days, you're completely gone from our system. Like you were never here. Poof.</em></p>
            
            <h3>5. Your Rights (What You Can Demand From Us)</h3>
            <p>Under Indian data protection laws and general human decency, you have the right to:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of all data we have about you <em>(spoiler: it's your name and number)</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>Rectification:</strong> Ask us to correct your information if it's wrong <em>(changed your name? New number? Let us know)</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>Erasure:</strong> Request deletion of your data <em>(aka unsubscribe - we'll wipe everything)</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>Object:</strong> Object to processing of your data <em>(though if you object to newsletters, that's just... unsubscribing)</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>Portability:</strong> Request your data in a transferable format <em>(we can send you a file with your name and number if you really want it)</em></p>
            
            <p>To exercise any of these rights, email us at <a href="mailto:contact@gossipyah.com">contact@gossipyah.com</a>. We'll respond within 7 days.</p>
            
            <h3>6. Third-Party Services (Who Else Sees Your Data)</h3>
            <p>We use these third-party services, and they may process your data:</p>
            
            <p><strong>WhatsApp (Meta):</strong> Obviously, since we send messages through WhatsApp. They have their own privacy policy. We can't control what Meta does, but we only share the minimum necessary information.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Google Workspace/Apps Script:</strong> We use Google's infrastructure for form submissions and data processing. Google has enterprise-grade security and their own privacy policy.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Cloud Storage Providers:</strong> Our database lives on cloud servers (AWS, Google Cloud, or similar). They have certifications up the wazoo.</p>
            
            <p><em>We've chosen reputable providers who take security seriously. We're not storing your data on someone's laptop in a coffee shop.</em></p>
            
            <h3>7. Cookies and Tracking (Spoiler: We Don't Really Use Them)</h3>
            <p>Our website uses minimal cookies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Essential cookies:</strong> Required for the website to function <em>(like remembering if you've submitted the form)</em></li>
                <li><strong>No tracking cookies:</strong> We don't track you across the internet</li>
                <li><strong>No advertising cookies:</strong> Because we have no ads</li>
                <li><strong>No social media pixels:</strong> We're not Facebook</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><em>Basically, our website is the digital equivalent of "mind your own business."</em></p>
            
            <h3>8. Children's Privacy (No Kids Allowed)</h3>
            <p>GossipYah is not intended for anyone under 18 years old. We don't knowingly collect data from children. If you're under 18:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't subscribe without parental consent</li>
                <li>If we discover you're under 18, we'll delete your data immediately</li>
                <li>Parents: if your child subscribed, email us and we'll remove them</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><em>Nothing personal, kids. It's a legal thing.</em></p>
            
            <h3>9. Data Breaches (What Happens If Things Go Wrong)</h3>
            <p>In the unlikely event of a data breach:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We'll notify affected subscribers within <strong>72 hours</strong></li>
                <li>We'll report to relevant authorities as required by law</li>
                <li>We'll explain what happened and what we're doing about it</li>
                <li>We'll offer guidance on protecting yourself</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><em>We hope this never happens, but if it does, we'll be transparent about it. No cover-ups here.</em></p>
            
            <h3>10. International Users (If You're Not in India)</h3>
            <p>GossipYah is based in India and primarily serves Indian users. If you're subscribing from outside India:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your data will be stored on servers that may be in India or other locations</li>
                <li>We comply with Indian data protection laws</li>
                <li>International data transfers follow industry best practices</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><em>Honestly though, why would you subscribe to Gurgaon gossip if you're in, say, Toronto? But hey, we don't judge.</em></p>
            
            <h3>11. Changes to Privacy Policy (We Might Update This Too)</h3>
            <p>We may update this privacy policy to reflect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Changes in our practices</li>
                <li>New legal requirements</li>
                <li>Feedback from users</li>
                <li>Technical improvements</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>If we make significant changes, we'll notify subscribers via newsletter. Continued use means you accept the updated policy.</p>
